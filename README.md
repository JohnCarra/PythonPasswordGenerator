# Password Generator
This is a password generator application written in Python using tkinter that generates strong and secure passwords according to Google Gmail's requirements. It uses modules such as secrets, zxcvbn, and cryptography to ensure password complexity, strength, and encryption. However, it is important to note that no password is 100% secure and it is recommended to use unique and strong passwords for each account and change them regularly.

## Requirements
This application requires the following Python packages and Python 3.X:

secrets  
string  
tkinter  
pyperclip  
zxcvbn  
cryptography  

To install these packages, run the following command for each package:

pip install -package name-

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code.  

## Usage
To use the password generator:

Run the program by executing the script in a Python environment.

Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password that meets the requirements of Google Gmail.  
The generated password will be displayed on the label widget.  
Optionally, click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the password to the clipboard for easy use.  
That's it! You can now use the generated password for your online accounts.
